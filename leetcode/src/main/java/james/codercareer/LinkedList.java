		 * K-th Node from End Get the Kth node from end of a linked list. It counts from
		 * 1 here, so the 1st node from end is the tail of list. For instance, given a
		 * linked list with 6 nodes, whose value are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, its 3rd node from
		 * end is the node with value 4.
		 * 
		 * A node in the list is defined as:
		 * 
		 * struct ListNode { int m_nValue; ListNode* m_pNext; };
		 * 
		 * Analysis: In a list with n nodes, its kth node from end should be the
		 * (n-k+1)th node from its head. Therefore, if we know the number of nodes n in
		 * a list, we can get the required node with n-k+1 steps from its head. How to
		 * get the number n? It is easy if we scan the whole list from beginning to end.
